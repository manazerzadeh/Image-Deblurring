# Image-Deblurring
In this project, we had a task of removing gaussian blurring and gaussian noise from images of CIFAR10 dataset. The CIFAR10 consists of 60000 32*32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. I designed two main models, which the latter performed the best. The model, tries to remove gaussian blurring by the aid of edge detection. I will explain the details as follows.
Due to the nature of gaussian blurring, the edges are affected the most by it. This model, adapted from Edge-Aware Deep Image Deblurring [1], stresses on the fact that gaussian blurring effects edges of an image the most. So, in their proposed model, they tried to decouple the task of edge detection and the task of deblurring. By doing so, they could first estimate the edges of an image, and then pass it to the deblurring model as a fourth channel to use that information for deblurring the image. Here is a scheme of their network:
